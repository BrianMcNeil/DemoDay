    <h2>  Hi my name is Brian McNeil and im am a hard working 15 yaer old male.I was born and rasied in Chicago Illinois. I have two sisters and one brother. I am currently a 10th grader at Paul Robeson High School.This past year I was on the honor roll for all school year. I was pround of myself and that pushed me to do the same this year. After high school I plan on getting a sports scholarship to Oregon University. This chaleges me to work hard on field and in the classroom. When I get to college i will major in technology. My motto is "pain is temporary but quiting last forever. This mean always push yourself and never quit because if you quit you will never know how far you could have gone. </h2>
